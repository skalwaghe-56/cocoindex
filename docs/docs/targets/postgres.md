# Postgres

Exports data to Postgres database (with pgvector extension).

## Data Mapping

Here's how CocoIndex data elements map to Postgres elements during export:

| CocoIndex Element | Postgres Element |
|-------------------|------------------|
| an export target | a unique table |
| a collected row | a row |
| a field | a column |

For example, if you have a data collector that collects rows with fields `id`, `title`, and `embedding`, it will be exported to a Postgres table with corresponding columns.
It should be a unique table, meaning that no other export target should export to the same table.

:::warning vector type mapping to Postgres

Since vectors in pgvector must have fixed dimension, we only map vectors of number types with fixed dimension (i.e. *Vector[cocoindex.Float32, N]*, *Vector[cocoindex.Float64, N]*, and *Vector[cocoindex.Int64, N]*) to `vector(N)` columns.
For all other vector types, we map them to `jsonb` columns.

:::

:::info U+0000 (NUL) characters in strings

U+0000 (NUL) is a valid character in Unicode, but Postgres has a limitation that strings (including `text`-like types and strings in `jsonb`) cannot contain them.
CocoIndex automatically strips U+0000 (NUL) characters from strings before exporting to Postgres. For example, if you have a string `"Hello\0World"`, it will be exported as `"HelloWorld"`.

## Spec

The spec takes the following fields:

* `database` ([auth reference](/docs/core/flow_def#auth-registry) to `DatabaseConnectionSpec`, optional): The connection to the Postgres database.
    See [DatabaseConnectionSpec](/docs/core/settings#databaseconnectionspec) for its specific fields.
    If not provided, will use the same database as the [internal storage](/docs/core/basics#internal-storage).

* `table_name` (`str`, optional): The name of the table to store to. If unspecified, will use the table name `[${AppNamespace}__]${FlowName}__${TargetName}`, e.g. `DemoFlow__doc_embeddings` or `Staging__DemoFlow__doc_embeddings`.

* `schema` (`str`, optional): The PostgreSQL schema to create the table in. If unspecified, the table will be created in the default schema (usually `public`). When specified, `table_name` must also be explicitly specified. CocoIndex will automatically create the schema if it doesn't exist.

## Attachments

### PostgresSqlCommand

Execute arbitrary Postgres SQL during flow setup, with an optional SQL to undo it when the attachment or target is removed.

This attachment is useful for capabilities not natively modeled by the target spec, such as creating specialized indexes, triggers, or grants.

Fields:

* `name` (`str`, required): A identifier for this attachment on the target. Unique within the target.
* `setup_sql` (`str`, required): SQL to execute during setup.
* `teardown_sql` (`str`, optional): SQL to execute on removal/drop.

Notes about `setup_sql` and `teardown_sql`:

* Multiple statements are allowed in both `setup_sql` and `teardown_sql`. Use `;` to separate them.
* Both `setup_sql` and `teardown_sql` are expected to be idempotent, e.g. use statements like `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` and `DROP ... IF EXISTS`.
* The `setup_sql` is expected to have an "upsert" behavior. If you update `setup_sql`, the updated `setup_sql` will be executed during setup.
* The `teardown_sql` is saved by CocoIndex, so it'll be executed when the attachment no longer exists. If you update `teardown_sql`, the updated `teardown_sql` will be saved and executed (instead of the previous one) during teardown.

Example (create a custom index):

```py
collector.export(
    "doc_embeddings",
    cocoindex.targets.Postgres(table_name="doc_embeddings"),
    primary_key_fields=["id"],
    attachments=[
        cocoindex.targets.PostgresSqlCommand(
            name="fts",
            setup_sql=(
                "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS doc_embeddings_text_fts "
                "ON doc_embeddings USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', text));"
            ),
            teardown_sql= "DROP INDEX IF EXISTS doc_embeddings_text_fts;",
        )
    ],
)
```
